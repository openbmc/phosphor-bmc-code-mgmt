      "message": "Milton is always on the lookout to prevent unnecessary wear of the flash by doing writes that are not needed, that\u0027s why for example we compare the u-boot contents before flashing to since it doesn\u0027t change that often.\nProbably a compare can be done on the files and if different, write the file, that can be an enhancement.",
