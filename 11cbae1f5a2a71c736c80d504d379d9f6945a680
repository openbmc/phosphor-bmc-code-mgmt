IBM does some stuff where they have a minimal device tree and then they do some detection and load a more robust device tree.  Maybe that\u0027s still all one image.\n\nIf you have image A1 -\u003e An, then using the image settings (via Meson config) is fine.  If you have image A1 -\u003e Bn, where they\u0027re not identical in IANA, you\u0027d need EEPROM data to be able to do that.\n\nGenerally, I like having it in the entity-manager data just because that\u0027s where we have all the other IANA information and I don\u0027t like the proliferation of meson options, but it isn\u0027t a hard requirement.",
