Perhaps add to the comment above something like \"// Now just.. . 30s has been shown to be long enough\" so we know it\u0027s based on observation.",

      "message": "Yeah, I think our Everest takes the longest of all systems, and it\u0027s 10-15s in the good path. It does bring up a good point on the error paths though. A power off could hang up to 2 minutes if a power off service gets hung. So, I\u0027m thinking maybe it\u0027s best to make this something huge. The user has requested a side switch, so we should basically wait as long as worst case. So 2 min service timeout then double that for safety, 4 minutes.",
