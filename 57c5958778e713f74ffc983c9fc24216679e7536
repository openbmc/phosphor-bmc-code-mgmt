The flow proposed here still supports multipart.\n\n\u003e Please raise a design update for https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/code-update.md for approval first.\n\u003e Please make sure any further design updates are aligned on discussion here https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/76645/comment/39e9183c_afc771dd/.\n\nbmcweb -\u003e bmc-code-updater is the only flow that\u0027s changing here, and the DBus api itself isn\u0027t changing.  Is there a design concern that you\u0027d like to see addressed?  Ideally if you could outline a requirement that you think this doesn\u0027t handle we could have a productive conversation.  From my perspective, this is a pretty minimal changeset, so if I were writing Marcs design doc, I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027d put in it.",
