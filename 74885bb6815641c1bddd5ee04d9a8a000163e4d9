      "message": "@paligill@gmail.com I was thinking about the ApplyTime for VRs. In most cases, VRs should use `OnReset`, since applying updates `immediately` could trigger a power change in the system and potentially cause abnormal behavior. Instead of adding a new API to determine the supported ApplyTime based on VR type, we can simply define the ApplyTime for VRs as `OnReset`. Do u have any concerns?",
