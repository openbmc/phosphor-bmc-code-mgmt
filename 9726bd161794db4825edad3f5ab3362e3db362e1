      "message": "This change would break the current default. I don\u0027t think having the `Wants` in this service file was ever needed because all the code update services start by default. What about if we just add all the old and new services with `After` and remove the `Wants`:\n```\nAfter\u003dxyz.openbmc_project.Software.Version.service\nAfter\u003dxyz.openbmc_project.Software.BMC.Updater.service\nAfter\u003dxyz.openbmc_project.Software.Manager.service\n```\nThat way we can support the old and the new for now (systemd figures out which services are running and schedules them in order of Before/After).",
