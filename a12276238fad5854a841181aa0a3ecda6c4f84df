      "message": "that is an interesting idea, i think we can give that a try. the only side effect would be that on reboot, the version id would be different because it be calculated on the os-release version only, but that\u0027s probably ok since nobody is hard-coding the version id, it\u0027s all dynamic based on functional associations. so perhaps something like:\nif ALLOW_DUPLICATE\n   if version exists and not functional\n   id \u003d version+\"uploaded\"",
