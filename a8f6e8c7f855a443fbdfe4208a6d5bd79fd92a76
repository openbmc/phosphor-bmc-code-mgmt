      "message": "I have a little concern about deleteImageManagerObject() being called twice.\n\nE.g. in the below code path:\n\n1. When the BIOS is updated successfully, the deleteImageManagerObject() is called:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt/blob/master/activation.cpp#L423\n2. Then it schedules a erase() call in the event loop to delete the activation:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt/blob/master/activation.cpp#L437\n\nThen the code runs here, and it calls deleteImageManagerObject() again.",
