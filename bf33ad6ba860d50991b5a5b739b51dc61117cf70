      "message": "I donâ€™t think we are actually taking 1 minute delay if the expected state is reached earlier. For example, if the state is achieved within 5 seconds, the update will proceed after just 5 seconds.\n\nI agree we could add a Meson option `host-powerstate-change-timeout` for the timeout, but 12 seconds seems too short for a graceful power-off on most platforms. We could increase the default timeout to 30 or even 60 seconds.",

Name it something like -\n\nhost-state-transition-timeout\n\nIn the description please mention that this option is being used in bios-software-update service to control the host state transition timeout when a host is turned off \u0026 on, before \u0026 after a bios update. Please fix the verbatim accordingly.",
