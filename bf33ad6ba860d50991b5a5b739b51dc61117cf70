      "message": "I donâ€™t think we are actually taking 1 minute delay if the expected state is reached earlier. For example, if the state is achieved within 5 seconds, the update will proceed after just 5 seconds.\n\nI agree we could add a Meson option `host-powerstate-change-timeout` for the timeout, but 12 seconds seems too short for a graceful power-off on most platforms. We could increase the default timeout to 30 or even 60 seconds.",
