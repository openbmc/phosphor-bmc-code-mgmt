I guess you could add a enum value here and it should work.\n\nI have changed the wording to \"pointer\" rather than \"object\" to make it more clear. As mentioned in description, the unique_pointer gets created by new flow and if this pointer doesn\u0027t exist, the flow fallback to getting the applyTime from settingsd as it was doing earlier. Please let me know if you have any other suggestion for this?",
