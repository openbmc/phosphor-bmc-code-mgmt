      "message": "Software Activation is the first interface you create as part of StartUpdate in a sync order. at that time you don\u0027t know the version yet, as image hasn\u0027t been parsed yet, so you cannot create the Version and other interfaces. So, i would suggest to create a composite for Version and associations only and create activation interface early. Activation interface is the one you need to change in case your image parsing and verification logic fails. Please refer to sequence diagram in design.",

      "message": "I would suggest its better to hide this in common layer by creating it for ActivationStatus \u003d Activating and deleting it when ActivationStatus \u003d Active. You already have API for setActivation, so its better to do it internally as part of that?",
